### This repository contains my solution to [Challenge 3](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-3-bouncy-balloons-bombs-and-booleans?uv=2020.3&courseId=5cf96c41edbc2a2ca6e8810f&projectId=5cf9639bedbc2a2b1fe1e848) in the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).


### Challenge:
- When the user presses spacebar, the baloon should float upward.
- Background should repeat with a smooth transition across the x-axis.
- Bombs and money tokens should be spawned randomly at intervals.
- If the balloon collides with the bomb, log "Game Over!", an explosion should occur with sound and particle effect and the bomb should be destroyed.
- If the balloon collides with the money tokens, fireworks and sound effects should be triggered.
- If the balloon hits the ground and the game is not over, it should bounce upward with sound effect.
- Game objects should be removed when they leave the screen.
- Player should only be able to float the balloon within set boundries.
